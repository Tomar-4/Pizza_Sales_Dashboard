# Pizza_Sales_Dashboard
Pizza Sales Dashboard | Power BI & SQL Server | Data Analyst Portfolio Project

📘 Description:

This project is an end-to-end data analytics solution built using Power BI and SQL Server, showcasing data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills. The dataset, originally in CSV format, was imported into SQL Server for preprocessing and then connected to Power BI for building an interactive two-screen dashboard — providing actionable insights on sales performance, product demand, and customer trends.

This project highlights the complete data analytics workflow: CSV → SQL Server → Power BI → Insights
